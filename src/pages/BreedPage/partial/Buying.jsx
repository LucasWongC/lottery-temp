                The process starts by signing into your account using walletðŸ‘›
                and clicking on the breed button from our website, My collection
                tab . Once youâ€™ve clicked on it, you would get to choose the two
                parent mongooses you want to breed. You must choose one as Male
                and the other as Female. Once youâ€™ve chosen the mongooses, the
                platform will show you the birthing feeðŸ’° and the estimated
                â›½gas fee applicable. If you agree on the price, you give your
                consent to the breeding by clicking on the button that says:
                â€˜Ok, let's breed.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p> </p>
              <br />
